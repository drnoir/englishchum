# An EnglishChatBot For Russians
# A conversational chatbot to aid Russian Speakers in learning English By Chris Godber

EnglishChum is a chatbot experiment built with Landbot that intereacts with users in a multi-language format, in this case - Russian to English in order to teach users about common english equivilants to common Russian phrases and words. I am aiming to get it to allow for more open questions, and some measurement of ability as well as develop the responses to seem human and show emotion and humour.
